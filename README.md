# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

## Overview <img align="right" src="heart.png">
A machine learning model for predicting cardiovascular disease. The primary goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can accurately classify patients as either having or not having cardiovascular disease based on their medical history and health metrics. By leveraging data science and machine learning techniques, we can analyze patients' health data and identify patterns that are indicative of cardiovascular disease, potentially leading to earlier diagnosis and better treatment outcomes.

## 💭 Why Cardiovascular Disease Prediction?
Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and early detection is critical for effective treatment. However, identifying patients at risk of cardiovascular disease can be challenging, as it often involves analyzing multiple health metrics and medical history. A machine learning model for cardiovascular disease prediction can streamline this process and provide accurate and timely diagnoses, potentially saving lives and improving patient outcomes.

## 🚀 Key Phases of the Project
This capstone project follows a structured approach, comprising the following key phases:

1. **[Data Collection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alphiree/cardiovascular-diseases-risk-prediction-dataset)**: The **[data](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2021.html)** used in this project was obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset, which was collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The dataset contains information on various health-related behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services, making it a valuable resource for predicting cardiovascular disease.

2. **[Data Preprocessing and EDA](https://github.com/ebeui/heart_disease_prediction/blob/main/eda_visualizations.ipynb)**: In this notebook, we will prepare the data for modeling by performing data cleaning, feature selection, and feature engineering. Our main goals are to remove missing values, handle outliers, and transform the data into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms. By using a variety of visualizations and statistical techniques, we will explore the data to extract meaningful information that will influence our decision-making throughout the development of the predictive model.

4. **[Model Development](https://github.com/yourusername/BrainStation_Capstone/blob/main/notebooks/model_development.ipynb)**: In this notebook, we will build and evaluate several machine learning models for cardiovascular disease prediction, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines. We will use cross-validation techniques to assess the models' performance and select the best-performing model for deployment.

5. **[Model Deployment](https://github.com/yourusername/BrainStation_Capstone/blob/main/notebooks/model_deployment.ipynb)**: In this notebook, we will deploy our final machine learning model as a web application using StreamLit. Users can input their health metrics and medical history into the application, and the model will predict their risk of cardiovascular disease.
